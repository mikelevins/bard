;;  Weight Balanced Binary Trees
;;
;;
;;
;;  This file has been modified from the MIT-Scheme library version to
;;  make it more standard. The main changes are
;;
;;   . The whole thing has been put in a LET as R4RS Scheme has no module
;;     system.
;;   . The MIT-Scheme define structure operations have been written out by
;;     hand.
;;
;;  It has been tested on MIT-Scheme, scheme48 and scm4e1
;;
;;  If your system has a compiler and you want this code to run fast, you
;;  should do whatever is necessary to inline all of the structure accessors.
;;
;;  This is MIT-Scheme's way of saying that +, car etc should all be inlined.
