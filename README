Bard 
A programming language
by mikel evins

Bard is a small, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It
is interpreted, dynamic, and impurely functional. It has a unique
object system influenced by, but different from, CLOS.

Bard is a dialect of Lisp, because Lisp is the family of languages
that offer me the most pleasure in programming. Bard is designed
primarily to make me happy--to make my work more pleasant. If someone
else likes it or finds it interesting that's a good thing, but it is
not a goal.
