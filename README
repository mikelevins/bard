Bard 
A programming language
by mikel evins

Bard is a small, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It
is interpreted, dynamic, and impurely functional. It has a unique
object system influenced by, but different from, CLOS.

Bard is a dialect of Lisp, because Lisp is the family of languages
that offer me the most pleasure in programming. Bard is designed
primarily to make me happy--to make my work more pleasant. If someone
else likes it or finds it interesting that's a good thing, but it is
not a goal.

You can learn more about Bard by reading the Bard Wiki at

Previous versions of Bard have been built for Linux, Windows, and
iOS. Contact mikel evins at the address mevins at me dot com if you
