	* templates-hierarchy.lisp:
	Fixed a couple of problems with some accessors in the NUMBER,
	STRUCTURE-OBJECT and STANDARD-OBJECT templates.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

	* cl-unification.system, cl-unification.asd:
	System definitions files (.asd and .system) modified in order to make
	dependency form CL-PPCRE optional.

	* lib-dependent/cl-ppcre-template.system: File added.

	* lib-dependent/cl-ppcre-template.lisp:
	Removed REQUIRE of CL-PPCRE.  Too brittle.

	* unification-package.lisp:
	Added a few exports and changed the actual package name (i.e., I put
	my money where my mouth is; the "published" package name is now a
	nickname).

	* apply-substitution.lisp:
	Fixed a couple of snags.  APPLY-SUBSTITUTION was not applied
	recursively and it was barfing on numbers.
	Current version is still incomplete, but it serves as a template for
	further development.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

	* lib-dependent/cl-ppcre-template.lisp, test/unification-tests.lisp:
	Modified Files:
	 	test/unification-tests.lisp
	Added Files:
	 	lib-dependent/cl-ppcre-template.lisp

	The cl-ppcre-template reuses E. Weitz's wonderful CL-PPCRE library
	to provide a seamless (YMMV) reuse of regular expressions within
	CL-UNIFICATION.

	* templates-hierarchy.lisp: Added LAMBDA-TEMPLATE.

	* substitutions.lisp:
	Added some functionality to extract all variables and/or all values
	from an environment or a frame.

	* match-block.lisp:
	Added MATCHF (whose name may change) to simplify the
	'destructuring-bind'-like syntax and behavior of the matching
	facilities.

	* COPYING: Dates updated.

	* unifier.lisp:
	Major API change to 'unify'.  It now accepts keywords.  Old code
	shouls not be affected, but new code is now more flexible.  Look the
	the STRING and (new) CHARACTER methods to see how this change is
	affecting the code.

	* variables.lisp: Some 'diff' unfathomable change happened.

	* unification-package.lisp: Added exports of a few symbols.

	* cl-unification.system, cl-unification.asd:
	Fixed a few snags and added "lib-dependent" module.

	* apply-substitution.lisp: Added some functionality and comments.

	* docs/html/index.html: Changed the position of the disclaimer.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

	* match-block.lisp:
	Made several changes to improve MATCH-CASE (following a note from Ivan
	Boldyrev from a long time ago), MATCHING and MATCH.

	Else-clauses are now handled correctly (AFAICT).

	Single variable templates in MATCH, MATCH-CASE and MATCHING clauses do
	not need to be quoted.

	MATCHING was generating one gensym'ed variable per clause without
	creating an appropriate enclosing LET.  This is now fixed.

	* substitutions.lisp:
	Changed the top comment and added a (:copier nil) option to the
	ENVIRONMENT defstruct, as COPY-ENVIRONMENT is defined later in the
	file.

	* cl-unification.system, cl-unification.asd:
	Added the new system building files with more meaningful names
	w.r.t. the name of the library.

	* unification.asd, unification.system:
	Marked the two system building files as 'obsolete', before removing
	them from the repository.  The new files are prefixed by 'cl-'.

	* templates-hierarchy.lisp, unifier.lisp:
	Fixed two problems with the unifier machinery.

	The first one had to do with the matching of NIL against SYMBOL and LIST
	in several places: essentially, the problem is incongruencies in the
	results of COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS in these cases.  I think I caught
	most of them: unification of lists and the occur-check were the obvious
	places where things went awry.

	The second problem had to do with the reader macro #T.  The original
	code generated an object at read time, which is not such a good idea.
	Now the code generates a call to MAKE-TEMPLATE with is evaluated later.
	Incidentally, the reader macro function is now called |sharp-T-reader|, in
	order to placate Emacs fontification.

	Modified Files:
	 	templates-hierarchy.lisp unifier.lisp

	* unification-package.lisp: Added missing export.

2005-10-25  author  <author@paniscia.disco.unimib.it>

	* unifier.lisp: Fixed problem with the unification of a list with a
	SEQUENCE-TEMPLATE.  The implementation was not checking that the
	length of the list was compatible with the length of the required
	elements in the template.

	Apart from that, keyword matching is still unimplemented.

	* match-block.lisp:
	Fixed problem with checking the presence of T and OTHERWISE clauses in
	MATCHING.

	* docs/html/number-template-class.html: Fixed a documentation bug.
	Thanks to Norman Werner for spotting it.

	* docs/html/index.html: Added link to "Mailing Lists" page.

	* docs/html/mailing-lists.html: File added.

	* unifier.lisp:
	Fixed two major bugs reported by Norman Werver.  Unification of
	strings and symbols and of numers and symbols was not recurring on
	VAR-UNIFY, as required; thus

		(unify '(?x ?x) '("asd" "qweert"))
	and
		(unify '(foo ?x baz) '(foo 42 ?x))

	would succed.
	The two cases are now fixed.

2005-04-27  mantoniotti  <mantoniotti@vault>

	* docs/html/control-flow.html: Fixed factorial example.

	* match-block.lisp:
	Added IGNORABLE declaration to MATCH macro expansion.
	This is useful in quieting various compilers.

	* match-block.lisp: Added acknowledgement to Peter Scott.

	* match-block.lisp: Fixed bug in condition signaling within MATCH-CASE.

	* templates-hierarchy.lisp:
	Fixed bugs in COLLECT-TEMPLATE-VARS for NUMBER-TEMPLATEs.
	If a variable was present, then the method was not returning a list.
	The treatment of constants like PI was also incorrect, as the numeric
	value was returned.  Retunrning () seems the right thing to do
	instead.

	* match-block.lisp:
	Added MATCH-CASE macro.  Slightly modified from the version provided
	by Peter Scott.

	* unification.asd: Added unification.asd file.

2005-04-21  mantoniotti  <mantoniotti@vault>

	* docs/html/links.html: Fixed, but not completed, the page.

2005-01-28  mantoniotti  <mantoniotti@vault>

	* docs/html/downloads.html: Added file `downloads.html'.

	* docs/html/index.html:
	Minor changes to text.  Fixed `download.html' link.

	* lambda-list-parsing.lisp, unifier.lisp:
	Fixed minor problem in Lambda List parsing.
	Also VALID-TEMPLATE-P was expanded, and it looks like it should become
	a generic function.
