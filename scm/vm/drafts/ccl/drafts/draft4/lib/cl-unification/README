CL-UNIFICATION

Marco Antoniotti (c) 2004-2008

The directory containing this file you are reading should contain the
code and the documentation of the CL-UNIFICATION package.

The package is a full-blown library to "unify" arbitrary CL objects
while constructing bindings for placeholders (unification variables)
in a "template" sublanguage.

Enjoy.
