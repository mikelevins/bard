;;; ==============================

;;; NOTE: In ANSI Common Lisp, the effects of adding a definition (or most
;;; anything else) to a symbol in the common-lisp package is undefined.
;;; Therefore, it would be best to rename the function SYMBOL to something 
;;; else.  This has not been done (for compatibility with the book).
