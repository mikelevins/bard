# Bard 
A programming language

by mikel evins

Bard is a small, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It
is interactive, dynamic, and impurely functional. It has a unique
object system influenced by, but different from, CLOS.

Bard is a dialect of Lisp, because Lisp is the family of languages
that offer me the most pleasure in programming. Bard is designed
primarily to make me happy--to make my work more pleasant. If someone
else likes it or finds it interesting that's a good thing, but it is
not my primary goal.

## Versions of Bard

- **0.2.x** An interpreter for a large subset of the language, used in a few commercial projects to implement rules systems and data compilers

- **0.3.x** An extension of the 0.2.x series of interpreters, which discarded certain domain-specific features in 0.2.x and replaced them with additional features of the core language. 0.3.x was marginally faster than 0.2.x, but both are fairly slow implementations.

- **0.4.x** The version that is presently under construction.  I
  conducted an extended experiment in implementing a novel Lisp by
  embedding it in Common Lisp. It worked well enough that I want to
  try a more extensive version of the same strategy with Bard, so that
  is the current focus of the Bard 0.4 effort. As always, I've
  archived earlier experiments in the attic.
