an experimental alternative c api for bard.

This api takes the approach of preferring to return scheme objects to
foreign functions instead of marshaling data, and providing API
functions to extract primitive values from those scheme objects.

The goal is, instead of having Bard cons up a whole lot of Objetive-C
data, we instead have the Objective-C runtime talk to Bard to have it
eval expressions and answer queries about the results.
