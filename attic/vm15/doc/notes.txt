How about a bard that is designed to compile to Javascript?

Base types are the same as JSON types, with a couple of additions:

methods are Javascript functions

functions are Javascript objects that wrap method tables like this:

{type: "function"
 methods [zero-arg-method,
          1-arg-methods={type1: method1, type2: method2,...}]},
          2-arg-methods={arg1-type1: {arg1-type1: method1-1,
                                      arg1-type2: method1-2, ...},
                         arg2-type1: {arg2-type1: method2-1,
                                      arg2-type2: method2-2, ...},
                         ...
                        },
         3-arg-methods,
         ...]
}
