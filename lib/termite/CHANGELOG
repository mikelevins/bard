Added concept of process naming.  It greatly helps debugging.  Calling
 the 'top' procedure in the console will show something like this:

> (top)

*** THREAD LIST:
#<thread #1 primordial>       RUNNING
#<thread #2 termite-dispatcher> WAITING #<condition-variable #3 #f>
#<thread #4 termite-linker>   WAITING #<condition-variable #5 #f>
#<thread #6 termite-spawner>  WAITING #<condition-variable #7 #f>
#<thread #8 termite-publisher> WAITING #<condition-variable #9 #f>
#<thread #10 termite-logger>  WAITING #<condition-variable #11 #f>
#<thread #12 termite-ping-server> WAITING #<condition-variable #13 #f>
#<thread #14 termite-publisher-dictionary> WAITING #<condition-variable #15 #f>
#<thread #16 termite-tcp-server> WAITING #<input-port #17 (tcp-server 3001)>


- Fixed and improved error logging a bit, should be more helpful now and
 is up-to-date with Gambit's changed to the 'display' procedure.

- Fixed a problem with MATCH macro
- TAGS are now unique objects and only get an UUID assigned if
  "exported" (ie sent to another node) to avoid the creation of symbols
  that will not be garbage collected (bug reported by Nicholas Walton)

- Removed useless code from match.scm that was impeding compilation 
  (reported by Guillaume Cartier)
- Termite is now licensed under the same term as Gambit is, as it will
  simplify inter-operation with Gambit's code
