# These are the installation instructions for Termite

#1 Install the latest version of Gambit-C

#2 Get the latest Termite and put it in Gambit's lib/ directory

$ cd /usr/local/Gambit-C/current/lib
$ svn checkout http://termite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ termite

#3 Copy the tsi script to Gambit's bin directory (optional) 
# That's for convenience so you can start a console that acts 
# like gsi but has Termite already loaded

# All done!
