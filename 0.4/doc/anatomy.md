# Anatomy of a Court

## Name

### The style of names

The name of a Court should be the name of some concrete and familiar aspect of the natural world that serves as a metaphor for the character of the Court. As examples,

* **The Court of Shades:** **Shades** are ghosts; this Court is the Court of Death and the Dead. "Shades" captures that sense, and also hints at other things about the Court: that it is mournful, cold, terrible, relentless, fearsome, and so on.
* **The Court of Stone:** **Stone** is the hard earth, a building material, the vault in which the treasures of the earth are stored. The Court of Stone reflects these qualities: it is hard, strong, patient, enduring, utterly faithful, unforgiving, rigid, greedy and jealous of its treasures.

When a Court is represented by a personification, an **avatar**, the personality of the avatar must reflect the character of the Court, and his or her name should symbolize that character.

The Queen of Winter is **Heirobhan**, whose name means "she who endures all". The King of Summer is **Caelethglandon**, the "master of celebrations".

To name your avatar, follow these steps:

1. Choose an epithet--that is, a brief description that captures the essence of the Court's personality
2. Play with the phrasing until it sounds good to you and still conveys the right idea. If it's a little ambiguous, so much the better, because then you can make its various interpretations part of the court.
3. If you want to present the name in one of the Faerie languages, work with mikel to choose a gloss for it.


### The naming language

There are several Faerie languages, but they are all really just minor variations of an ur-language called *ruulh*.

The spellings are not arbitrary; there is an organized orthography. Likewise, the vocabulary and grammar are drawn from piles of notes I have about the languages of Ymra.

I don't want to turn naming into a highly technical exercise, so I will routinely cheat and break my own rules of grammar and phonetics in order to create appealing names. Work with me if you want a name in a Faerie language, but don't be afraid to just stick some nice sounds together and then ask me to help you figure out how to fit it into the world.

If you actually want to know more about the rules of grammar, phonetics, and orthography, let me know and I'll give you as much as you can stand.

Remember that each Court speaks _ruulh_ its own way, so you have a lot of freedom to bend the language the way you want.

As an aside, "_ruulh_" itself means "whisper", and it shows up in "_Hruulcaldulash_", the "fortress of the whisperer in the dark", a ruined fortress of the destroyed Seafaring Court in the waters off the southwestern continent, where the Whispers of Fate maintain their monastic existence.

Also, remember that you don't have to have a gloss for your avatar's name; you can just call him or her "The Abundant One", "Allmother", "He Who Dances Blind", or whatever phrase you've decided is the correct name.

The names of traditional gods and heroes are most often of this kind; for example:

* Perseus - He who ravages
* Zeus - He of the sky
* Thor - He who thunders
* Juno - She of the plentiful time
* Cernunnos - He who bears horns
* Yahweh - He who makes


## Aspects

An Aspect is a concrete person, place, or thing that embodies the character of the Court. When someone sees the Court, or an agent of the Court, he or she is always actually seeing an Aspect. 

Talking to or making gifts to an Aspect is a way to summon a Court. Whenever an Aspect is addressed or touched or interacted with, it creates an attraction that draws the Court toward it.

Some things may be Aspects of more than one Court.

When the Court mainfests itself, it always mainfests as one or more Aspects, and decorates its minions with Aspects. Mortals who serve a Court will tend to display its Aspects even without thinking about it.

When creating a Court, try to think of Aspects in each of the following categories that are associated with your Court:

* Features of weather, landscape, sky, and sea
* Food and drink
* Artifacts and materials used to make them
* Beasts, birds, fish, and bugs
* Places
* Elves, sprites, goblins, phantoms, monsters, and otherworldly beings

## Avatars

An avatar is a particularly powerful Aspect, a being who personifies the Court. Some courts have no avatar; some have more than one.

It's simplest to create a Court with a single distinguished avatar whose personality stands for and embodies the character of the Court, but you're free to create a Court with no avatar, or with several, if the nature of the Court demands it. It may be a little harder to play a Court that doesn't have a single avatar, but it's certainly allowed and doable.

Examples: the Queen of Winter (Court of Winter); the Summer King (Court of Summer); the Grey Man (Court of Shades).

## Attributes

Attributes are qualities of the world that are associated with a Court. When a Court approaches in power, these things become stronger in the surrounding environment. Evoking these qualities is another way to attract the attention of a Court and perhaps summon it.

As simple examples, when Winter approaches, the air grows colder; water begins to chilla dn freeze; fog forms in the air; people grow more door and pessimistic, and more concerned with laws, rules, and balancing scales. The just become more just; the vengeful become more vengeful. People grow more preoccupied with their memories.

When creating a Court, try to think of attributes in these categories that are assocaited with your Court:

* Qualities of personality
* Colors
* Temperature
* Emotions
* Virtues
* Vices
* Attributes of mind (memory, hope, imagination, and so on)

## Resources

Each Court has a set of resources used to pay for actions and improvements to the Court.

### Ether

Ether is the substance of faerie flesh. Every action requires either a mortal agent or something made of Ether to execute it. If you run out of Ether, you cannot make any more artifacts until you've generated more.

It is a kind of magical mist that arises from the land that belongs to the Court, and can be shaped by the will of the Court into physical things: elves, sprites, castles, armor, and so on. The more Ether that is being produced for you, the more things you can make.

You may use Ether to make **artifacts**:

* **minions:** cretures that obey you
* **weapons** and **armor:** magical weapons and armor that may be equipped by your minions
* **sigils:** symbols that maybe borne by your minions or allies to grant them a portion of your power
* **sanctuaries:** buildings, groves, caverns, and other magical places that conceal and protect your minions and allies
* **spells:** stored-up actions that can be triggered at a later time, or deployed to act continuously on some person, place, or thing

Each Court has its own set of Ether artifacts.

The Ether of a Court is dispersed and dispelled by its anathema, which is why the Court's minions cannot abide it.

Bringing more territory under your dominion increases the rate of Ether production. You can further increase production of Ether by transforming the land to be more like your ideal territory.

### Power

Power is the ability of your Court to cause change in the world. Every action you take expends some of your Power. If you run out of Power, all your minions and all your works become inert until you've generated more.

Power is produced by two things:

* the presence of organized Ether (your buildings, minions, and other creations) on land that is under your dominion
* gifts, prayers, and blessings of Mortals dedicated to your Aspects or Avatars

The gifts of Mortals produce quick bursts of Power; the presence of Ether constructs on your land produces slow, steady accumulation of Power.

It is possible to secure enormous Power by inducing mortals to worship you, but that's a risky business. You risk becoming a god. A god draws **all** of its Power from the devotion of mortals; it loses the steady, reliable Power source of Ether. Gods therefore tend to be at the mercy of their worshippers, and are sometimes taken in directions that they would never have wished to go.


## Anathema

Each Court has a set of things that are anathema to it. For example, silver is anathema to the Court of Shades; gold is anathema to Winter. Faeries of Winter cannot abide the touch of gold, which burns and dissolves them.

When creating a Court, you must choose four things that are anathema to your Court: 

* a substance (a metal, bone, wood, running or still water, salt, etc.)
* a Court or Avatar
* a time of day (noon, midnight, twilight, etc.)
* a type of place (a crossroads, a bonfire, a wheat field, a well, etc.)

Try to choose anathemas that are fairly ordinary, common things. That will be inconvenient for you, but it is a way to level the playing field for all players. Your Court is not complete until you have fourt anathemas that the other players agree to.


## Actions

Each Court has a set of available **actions**. An action is a command that you can give to your minions that will cause some event to take place in the world.

Actions fall into five categories:

* **Construction:** order your minions to make Ether artifacts
* **Attacks:** order your minions to damage a rival or other target
* **Offers:** promise to grant something to another player or a non-player Court in return for something.
* **Glamours:** a glamour is an attempt to make something yours. A successful glamour on a mortal makes him or her your servant. On a rival's minion, it transforms it to a minion of yours. On a place or thing, it makes it part of your domain. A glamour may be temporary or permanent. If it's on a place, the place becomes part of your domain, generates Ether for you, and if you place Ether artifacts on it, it generates Power for you.
* **Gifts:** a gift transfers control of something that is yours to the target, which may be a mortal or another Court. Once the gift is given, you cannot control it any longer (but you can place a **spell** on a gift that continues to work after the gift is given; faeries are wary of gifts for that reason).
