# jackdaw

Jackdaw is a bare-bones template of a Kawa project that builds a
"Hello World" application using JavaFX.

It doesn't have to use JavaFX; just replace the JavaFX code in
src/jackdaw.scm with whatever you want.

I made jackdaw because I've been using Kawa quite a bit lately and I
wanted to have a skeleton project handy to make setup quicker and
easier. Maybe it'll serve the same way for others, as well.

A prebuilt copy of Kawa 1.14 is in the lib folder, but you can easily get
and build it yourself from:
