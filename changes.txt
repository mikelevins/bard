0.2.6

- define-macro implemented, exposing macros in the surface language

0.2.5

- macros implemented
- quasiquote implemented

0.2.4

- added a To-Do list
- added generators
- nelson subsystem: fixed several bugs in data-conversion to
  Objective-C
- nelson: added special form for actions
- nelson: expanded the nelson build, adding a special
  nelson version of the standalone interpreter
- changed representation of frames for speed
- added as_integer to C API
- fixed a bug in the <string> method of any
- corrected the debug name of the uuid function
- added <frame> method to map
- added error APIs to the C API

0.2.3

- much faster implementation of read-lines

0.2.2

- modified frames to support equal? keys

- added read-text, read-file, and eval to the language

0.2.1

- fixed a bug that prevented rest args from working.

0.2.0

- experimented some with representation of types, in order to support
  user-defined types; this feature is not yet in, but will be in the
  near future

- protocol implementation is ndergoing changes. in 0.2.0 the protocols
  (except for Anything and Type) are not first-class objects, and many
  protocol functions are unimplemented while I tinker with the representations

- experimented with generators and series (possibly-infinite data
  structures that encapsulate generators); not ready for prime time,
  but a future Bard release may expose generators and series as a tool
  for iteration

- <output-stream> and <input-stream> are replaced by <iostream>

- lists are now represented by an abstract interal protocol (%cons,
  %car, %cdr, etc.) to make it easy to switch representations

- experimented with lists represented by binary trees, but the Van
  Horn implementation of random-access-lists does not perform as
  advertised in Gambit. Operations advertised as Olog(N) were measured
  linear, and constant factors are higher than for native cons
  implementation, so rolled back to conses until I can find or write a
  suitable implmentation of functional sequences.

- frames are now represented by weight-balanced binary trees

- added repeat and with-exit; this is a very general solution to
  looping, but should be regarded as a temporary placeholder to be
  replaced at some point with a better functional alternative. exits
  bound by with-exit are in fact full continuations, and it's probably
  not a good idea to expose them in this way

- experimented with an pgrade to Gambit 4.6.6, but rolled back after
  segfaults in iOS builds; the toolchain currently is still based
  on Gambit 4.6.1

- Bard project now includes Cocoa test harnesses for iOS and Mac OSX

- Makefiles now build iOS and MacOSX libraries with exposed C entry
  points and data-marshaling support

- function dispatch and application cons much less and are faster

0.1.3

- updated the namer example to use new primitives.

- made a few small changes and additions to protocols; updated the reference

- fixed a bug in error reporting

- added basic combinators as primitives

- added comprehensive tests for all protocol functions

- fixed a bug in get

- fixed some inconsistencies in frame merging

- improved performance of many protocol functions

- updated makefile to build iOS libraries

- reorganized the project directory, removing obsolete legacy code

0.1.2

- adjusted repl output to be a little more readable

- added Bard versions of Nelson puzzle descriptions

- added Puzzle protocol for Nelson

- improved frame implementation a little

- changed function application to cons less

- added the 'time' special form for crude timing measurements

- added an (embryonic) C API for the library

- added an XCode project for testing the static library build

- rewrote the Makefile to support builing as either an executable or a
  static library

0.1.1

- fixed the initial prompt at repl startup

- changed the repl to print the version string instead of an arbitrary
  banner

- edited, corrected, and expanded bard.rtf, the interpreter reference

- changed open to accept a frame argument for settings
