### _mikel evins <mikel@evins.net>_

bard 0.8 (branch paip-scheme): This branch is a reference VM. It is
Peter Norvig's Scheme compiler and VM from Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence Programming, lightly edited so that it loads using ASDF,
and including only those sources listed in the system definition in
bard.asd. Its purpose is to serve as a starting point for the bard 0.8
implementation, for which see the 0.8 branch.
