What if Javascript were an intended major target platform for Bard?

What if the base language were designed to compile well into
Javascript? (or at least to have a lot in common with JavaScript in its
base concepts)

Base types:

  nothing  null
  Boolean Boolean
  Number  Number
  Text    String
  Sequence Array  
  Map      Object
  Method   function
  Function [custom generic function implementation]
  Category [custom category implementation]


? nothing
nothing

? true
true

? 2
2

? (+ 2 3)
5

? "Foo"
"Foo"

? [0 1 2 3 4]
(0 1 2 3 4)

? {:name "Fred" :species "human"}
{:species "human" :name "Fred"}

? (define fred {:name "Fred" :species "human"})
fred

? (fred :name)
"Fred"

? (get fred :name)
"Fred"

? (method (x)(* x x))
(method (x)(* x x))

? (define fib (method (x)
                 (if (<= x 1)
                   1
                   (+ (fib (- x 1))
                      (fib (- x 2))))))

fib

? (function Sequence Index)
(function Sequence Index)

? (define nth (function Sequence Index))
nth

? (define-method nth ((s Sequence)(n Index))
    (element s n))

? (category Sequence)
(category Sequence)

? (categories Vector Map Sequence)
(category Sequence)
