$ (f &rest args) => vals
  macro

  $ is a synonym for FUNCALL whose sole purpose is to make FUNCALLing
  function values more compact and convenient in functional
  code. Recommended use is in expressions where passing functions as
  values is natural, but where the use of FUNCALL makes the code read
  awkwardly, or where it seems unnecessarily verbose. Use $ sparingly.

  EXAMPLE: 
    (some (fn (v) ($ test v x)) 
          seq)

FN (args &body body) => vals
  macro

  FN is shorthand for LAMBDA, and simply expands into a LAMBDA
  expression. Like $, it's intended only to make functional code more
  compact in cases where otherwise LAMBDA and FUNCALL tend to make it
  grow to unwieldy shapes. Use sparingly.

  EXAMPLE: 
    (filter (fn (it) (member it test-list))
            items)
