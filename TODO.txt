Bard To-Do list

1. [DONE] generators

2. unquote & macros

3. series (generators with memoization and support for the List protocol)

4. loop (like named let -- syntax is the same as generate, but without yield)

(loop ((x 0)
       (y 1))
  (then y (+ y 1)))

Use with-exit to escape:

(with-exit (return)
  (loop ((x 0)
         (y 1))
    (if (> y 100)(return y))
    (then y (+ y 1))))

5. fast pure-functional lists

6. fast pure-functional frames

7. User-defined record types

8. User-defined taxonomies with C3 type linearization and method dispatch

9. Thread-safe module variables (likely using Gambit mailboxes)

10. Image saving and loading

11. VM

12. first-class protocols

13. modules

14. lazy list comprehensions (using generators?)
